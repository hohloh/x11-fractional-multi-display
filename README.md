# X11-fractional-multi-display
An autostart script introducing fractional display scaling for X11 using multiple displays. Includes ordering of display outputs.

## Disclaimer and current issues 
This script is designed to run as an autostart application and needs a corresponding .desktop file. I created it under GNOME 40.4.0.
